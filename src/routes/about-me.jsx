        I&apos;m a music producer, sound designer, composer, arranger,
        songwriter, and recording artist. I&apos;ve been messing around with
        beats and sounds for over 12 years, blending digital and analog stuff to
        make sounds that are nostalgic, but still fresh. I love using sounds and
        tones from all sorts of gadgets, like computer processors and even smart
        ovens. You can hear my work all over the place—from small artists, big
        artists, even Adidas commercials. If I&apos;m not doing music, I&apos;m
        probably either writing code or playing video games. Feel free to poke
        around my projects——I&apos;m really proud of my portfolio so far and I
        love collaborating, so reach out if my stuff interests you!
