        I&apos;m a music producer, sound designer, composer, arranger,
        songwriter, and recording artist. I&apos;ve been messing around with
        beats since I was a kid, blending digital and analog stuff to make a
        sound that&apos;s nostalgic, but still fresh. I love using sounds and
        tones from all sorts of gadgets, like computer processors and even smart
        ovens. Connect with me and let&apos;s journey into more uncharted sound
        territories, where old meets new, and we cook up this symphony of
        whatever feels right. Feel free to poke around my projects——they all
        poke around a computer&apos;s emotions, you know, bit by bit.
